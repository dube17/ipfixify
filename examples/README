IPFIXify is based around the IPFIX Protocol. A firm understanding of
PENs, templates, elements, flows, option templates, and data templates
will be required to take full advantage of IPFIXify.

For more information on the IPFIX Protocol, visit
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Flow_Information_Export

This directory consists of a list of examples of how IPFIXify can be
used as is, or referenced as examples to build a custom
implementation.

It is highly recommended that if you decide to build your own
configurations, that you acquire a PEN (Private Enterprise Number).

The application can be found at
http://pen.iana.org/pen/PenApplication.page

Another consideration is the IPFIX Collector that will receive data
from IPFIXify will likely require support for any IPFIX elements that
are included in the configuration file outside the standard
elements. Please contact the vendor of the IPFIX collector for more
information.

Visit www.plixer.com if you need an IPFIX Collector to experiment
with, or use in a production setting.

For full disclosure, IPFIXify is a application orginally conceived and
developed by Plixer. that has since been released as open source.
Happy IPFIXifying!
